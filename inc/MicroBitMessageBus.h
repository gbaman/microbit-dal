/**
  * Class definition for the MicroBitMessageBus.
  *
  * The MicroBitMessageBus is the common mechanism to deliver asynchronous events on the
  * MicroBit platform. It serves a number of purposes:
  *
  * 1) It provides an eventing abstraction that is independent of the underlying substrate.
  * 2) It provides a mechanism to decouple user code from trusted system code 
  *    i.e. the basis of a message passing nano kernel.
  * 3) It allows a common high level eventing abstraction across a range of hardware types.e.g. buttons, BLE...
  * 4) It provides a mechanims for extensibility - new devices added via I/O pins can have OO based
       drivers and communicate via the message bus with minima impact on user level languages.
  * 5) It allows for the possiblility of event / data aggregation, which in turn can save energy.
  * It has the following design principles:
  *
  * 1) Maintain a low RAM footprint where possible
  * 2) Make few assumptions about the underlying platform, but allow optimizations where possible.
